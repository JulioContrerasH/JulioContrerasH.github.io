This has applications in quickly locating regions of interest, connecting research documentation to real-world datasets, and enabling seamless human-machine interaction with geospatial databases. \ud83d\udccc Inputs: TextPrompt [input]: A descriptive textual prompt or query which will guide the model to generate or locate the specific area within the satellite image. ItemTensor [target]: Optional. Single images (1 x C x B x H) or multiple images (N x C x B x H) represented as 4D tensors, serving as a base or context for the text-to-image transformation. ItemTensor [extra]: Optional. This field can be used to include additional tensors, such as previously generated satellite images or related geospatial data, that might enhance the generation process. They should be specified within the ImageCollection dataclass. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Use Cases: Research Linking: Connect satellite images with associated environmental, urban, or geological studies by referencing the documentation. Interactive Geospatial Querying: Enable researchers and analysts to directly locate areas of interest in large satellite datasets using textual descriptions. Rapid Data Highlighting: Visualize specific regions within geospatial datasets based on current events, such as areas affected by recent natural disasters, deforestation, or urban expansion. \ud83d\udd0d Example: Consider a massive Landsat dataset spanning several years. With the Text-to-Image model, users can quickly highlight areas of interest: import mlstac name = \"All-For-One/text_to_image_satellite\" dataset = mlstac.dataset(name, streaming=True, framework=\"torch\") image = dataset.generate_image_from_text(\"Show regions affected by deforestation in Amazon in 2021\") # Outputs: An image highlighting areas within the Amazon rainforest that have indications of deforestation in the year 2021.","title":"about"},{"location":"text_to_image/#text-to-image","text":"The Text to Image task focuses on generating or highlighting areas within satellite images based on textual prompts or references.
